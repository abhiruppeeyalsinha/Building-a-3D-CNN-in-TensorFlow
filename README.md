# Building-a-3D-CNN-in-TensorFlow
It is a basic understanding of 3D image analysis, 3D MNIST Dataset has been used in here. 3D convolutions applies a 3 dimensional filter to the dataset and the filter moves 3-direction (x, y, z) to calculate the low level feature representations. It is helpful in event detection in videos, 3D medical images etc. They are not limited to 3d space but can also be applied to 2d space inputs such as images.
